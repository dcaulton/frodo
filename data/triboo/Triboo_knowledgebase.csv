When your course reaches the end date set-up, then the course card display will be different and a note will be added to the learner, to let them know that the course is archived. 
Learners can still have access to the course if they are already enrolled. However the course is not visible in the catalog anymore and new learners cannot self-enrolled to this archived course.
The courses data are avaiable on Triboo Analytics and on the learner transcript.

Instructor, Studio Admin and Platform Admin will be warn in the instructor dashboard and the Admin Center that the course is archived. It is their responsability to enroll learners to archived courses.

Note: Do not import an image which has a name containing special characters (é, è…). If you upload an image in the objective of it being the badge illustration, do not put spaces either.
In the window which opens, select the image you want to upload and click on Open.
Note: You can import several files at the same time by pressing the SHIFT OR CTRL keys (SHIFT and Command on Mac) to select several files, then click on Open.
When the upload is completed. The imported file appears on the Files & Uploads page. You will find the file URL, the type of file and the date it was added.
Note: The URL in the static code format is used as an identification for all image and file you upload. Everytime you upload a file or an image, it is to use in the studio. To do so, you will always need the static code of the image/file.
To add more files, click on Browse your computer again.
If you have multiple pages of images and files, it may not appear at the top of the page. To see images according to an upload date, double click on Date Added.
Note: When you wish to replace an image/file, you have to delete the previous one so that you can import a new image/file with the same name as the one to be replaced. If you don’t delete the previous one, the risk is that it isn’t uploaded because of the identical name code.
To delete a file, click on the trash icon on the right of the file URL.
Unlock a file
By default, the file uploaded is locked that means that the web URL only allows learners who are enrolled in your course and signed in to access the file.
To unlock a file, desable the switch icon in the row for the file.

Sections
The Sections represent the highest category in the course heirarchy. They can, for example, correspond to the weeks of the course or the sequences:  Section 1 will be named Week 1, Section 2 will be named Week 2, etc. The name of the sections appears in the menu to the left of the platform.
Section MinimumRecommended1Between 4 and 8
SubSections
A Subsection represents one sub-category of a section. That corresponds to one lesson, which is made up of different typs of units such as videos, texts, images, discussions, exercises and homework. It is an interactive representation of material you would cover during one part of a classic course. The name of the subsections also appears in the menu to the left of the platform.
�Note:   A subsection should contain at least one unit. 
Subsection MinimumRecommended1Between 5 and 10
Units
One Unit constitutes a supplementary category for organizing your course content. Unlike the sections and subsection, the units do not appear at the left of the platform. 
�Note:   A subsection should contain at least one component.
Unit MinimumRecommended1Between 1 and 4
Avoid to do more than that or else navigating will be difficult for the learner as he cannot go back to the previous page from the course outline. The learner can only navigate between the units with the navigation icons at the bottom of the page. 
Components
Components make up a unit and contain the course content. There are 4 types of components: Resources, Learner Activities, Quiz and Blended Learning. One unit can contain as many different types of components as desired, but we recommand not to add more than 2 to 3 components.
Resources
Add content to your course, such as text, vide, SCORM module, PDF…
Learner Activities
Train your learners with collaborative activities and/or add discussion forum.
Quiz
Use the exercise problems to add quizzes and automatic corrections. There are several types of quizz that you can add, and many ways of including it in your course.

Certificate Design
To add a certificate for your course, follow these steps.
1. Create your certificate template on a PowerPoint document (A4 format). Check the dedicated article.
Check with your Project Manager and Customer Success Manager to make sure the template is feasible
Validate the content and the layout
Send the final version to your Project Manager and Customer Success Manager 
2. When the certificate template has been integrated, You can preview the certificate to see how it will appear to a learner taking the course in the selected mode. Go under the Instructor Dashboard menu, select Certificates, you can now generate an example of the certificate.

Enable Certificates
Before  learners  can download certificates, you must enable certificates for your course.
1. From the Instructor Dashboard menu, select Certificates.
2. Click on “Generate Example Certificates” 
Certificates in an Instructor-Paced Course
In instructor-paced courses, two behaviors are possible.
By default, the instructor will decide when to generate the course certificates. Certificates need to be generated manually. To do so, from the Instructor Dashboard, select Certificates and use the Certificate Export section to generate the certificates.
You can configure your course to decide when learners will be informed that certificates are available. To do so, go to the Advanced Settings of your course and set the Certificates Display Behavior:
“End”: Learners will be informed when certificates are generated and the course ended.If the course hasn’t ended, then no message is displayed in Progress.If the course has ended, but the instructor hasn’t generated the certificates, then all learners see in Progress a message saying “The certificate is not yet available because it’s an instructor-paced course”.If the course has ended, and the instructor has generated the certificates, and the learner has a passing score, then the learner sees the button “Download Your Certificate” in Progress and a download link on the course card.If the course has ended, and the instructor has generated the certificates, but the learner has not a passing score, then the learner sees a message “You haven’t passed the course” in Progress.“Early no info” (option set by default): Learners with a passing score will be informed when certificates are generated.If the instructor has not generated the certificates, then no message is displayed in Progress.If the instructor has generated the certificates, and the learner has a passing score, then the learner sees the button “Download Your Certificate” in Progress and a download link on the course card.If the instructor has generated the certificates, but the learner has not a passing score, then no message is displayed in Progress.“Early with info”: All learners will be informed when certificates are generated.If the instructor has not generated the certificates, then a message “The certificate is not yet available because it’s an instructor-paced course” is displayed in Progress.If the instructor has generated the certificates, and the learner has a passing score, then the learner sees the button “Download Your Certificate” in Progress and a download link on the course card.If the instructor has generated the certificates, but the learner has not a passing score, then the learner sees in Progress a message saying “You haven’t passed the course”.
2. Alternatively, Instructor-paced courses can also be configured to enable Learner-Generated Certificates. In this scenario, learners will be able to request / generate their course certificate as soon as they pass the course, similarly to Self-paced courses. To do so:
From the Instructor Dashboard menu, select Certificates.In the Learner-Generated Certificates box, click on “Enable Learner-Generated Certificates” button to activated it.Confirm on the modal by clicking on “Ok“
�  Note: To switch back to the default behavior, you can click on “Disable Learning-Generated Certificates”.
Certificates in an Self-Paced Course
In self-paced courses, learners can request a course certificate as soon as they pass the course according to the Grading rules of the course. In their course Progress page, they should now see a message saying they qualified for a certificate and they can click on the button “Request Certificate” to generate one. Once the certificate is generated, learners see a message saying their certificate is available and they can download it by clicking on “Download Your Certificate”. A link “Download Certificate” should also appear on the course card.
If they haven’t requested their certificate yet, when they reach the end of the course and click the “Finish” button, we automatically request the generation of the certificate, so it’s ready to download from their course Progress page or from the course card.
Reminder: your course certificate is not available for issuing to learners until it is enable. Before enabling the certificate, check the following points:
The Course Completion rule and the Overall Grade Range criteria to get the certificate is in conformity with what you want.

Caution
As a best practice, do not make request changes to certificates in a running course if it is possible that certificates have already been issued to learners, because different learners might be awarded certificates with different details for the same course."

an image mapped input problem, you need the following elements:
The
height and width of the image in pixels.Coordinate
pairs that define the region or regions where you want learners to click.
To collect the information, you need about your image, use an image editing tool such as Microsoft Paint. To specify a rectangular region, you need two coordinate pairs: the upper-left corner and the lower-right corner.
� Note: The coordinate pairs for all images start with (0,0) in the upper-left corner of the image and increase in value toward the lower-right corner, similar to the progression of reading English.

https://csc.learning-tribes.com/2019/02/21/adding-videos/,Working with Video Component,"Working with Video Component
When adding a video to a course, first post the video on video hosting platform or directly on Triboo, then create a link to the video within the course. The video is therefore played through the video player. The video player supports video formats .mp4, .webm, .ogg, and .mpeg. 
Note: To be sure that all the browsers will be able to play the video, we highly recommend using mp4 format.
Note: Do not add special character to your name file.
The Edx player can access YouTube videos. However, since YouTube is not accessible everywhere, we recommend to upload your videos directly into Triboo. When a learner consults a video from the course, if YouTube is not accessible to the learner, the video from the third party site will start up automatically. The learner can also click on the link to download the video from the third party site.
You can use any third party site to post your videos. Remember that this site will undoubtedly need to be able to manage high user traffic.
Note: We also recommend optimizing the size of your videos. It must be less than 80Mb."
https://csc.learning-tribes.com/2019/02/21/drag-and-drop/,Drag and Drop,"Drag and Drop
The drag and drop is a problem allowing the learner to move elements from a point A to a point B. 
In this example, we are going to move text or image elements onto a background image. It is possible to define as many draggable elements, and as many target zones as you wish. The learner completes this problem once all the draggable elements  have found their correct target zone. 
Here is a quick guide to understanding the elements of the Drag and Drop problem type:
<img decoding=""async"" src=""https://i0.wp.com/csc.learning-tribes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Drag-and-drop_hint.png?resize=350%2C317&#038;ssl=1"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-1788"" width=""350"" height=""317"" srcset=""https://i0.wp.com/csc.learning-tribes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Drag-and-drop_hint.png?w=884&amp;ssl=1 884w, https://i0.wp.com/csc.learning-tribes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Drag-and-drop_hint.png?resize=300%2C272&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/csc.learning-tribes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Drag-and-drop_hint.png?resize=768%2C697&amp;ssl=1 768w"" sizes=""(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" data-pagespeed-url-hash=""1230540578""/>

4. Complete the
following fields: 
Display name: corresponding to the title of the poll.Feedback: give the learners a feedback after their answers are submitted.Private Results: allow or block the results from showing after polling.Maximum Submissions: determine the maximum number of times the learner can submit an answer to the poll. 
� Note : Putting a value other than 1 in this field
implies that the Private Results field should have True as an answer. Putting 0
as the value in this field allows the learners to submit an answer any number
of times they wish.
Answer: write asuggested
answer to the poll question.
� Note : take note that if the answer is changed after the polling starts, the learners who will have voted for that answer will have their votes automatically attributed to the new answer. Consequently, an answer such as « true » should not be replaced by an answer with the opposite meaning – such as « false ». 
If a suggested answer is deleted, the learner votes in favor of that
answer will also be deleted automatically. The learners can therefore vote
again and they won’t be penalized as far as their progress in the MOOC. 
Question: write the question.Image URL: add an image to the question, putting either the URL link or, if the image was already uploaded to the Files & Uploads part of the course, retrieve the studio link (link format : </static/nom_image>).
� Note : it is possible to put a written
answer only (Answer) OR an image (URL Image) OR a written answer with an image.

https://csc.learning-tribes.com/2019/02/21/numerical-input/,Numerical Input,"Numerical Input
A numerical input problem accepts text input by the learner and evaluates it based on its numeric value. The answer is correct if it is within a specified numerical tolerance of the expected answer.
Put the question first and then the answer after the = sign. Add, if necessary, after the +- sign, the margin or percentage of
 error.
 Example:
What is the value of Pi :
     = 3.14159 +- .02
Enter the approximate value of 502×9 :
     = 4518 +- 15%

For example, let’s say you have a bank of 100 questions, but you want to just show 25 random questions from this bank to each learner so that that each will receive a unique assessment. Below we will delve into creating the question bank.
When you enter Studio, from the home page you will see, to the top-right, a green button that says “+ New Library”. Click this button.
A “Create New Library” form will appear at the top of the page. Fill out the following information:
Library Name – For general identification Organization – This is where you would specify the platform you desire the Library to appear in.Library Code – Unique code that identifies the library
After the form is completely filled, click the “Create” button below. 
Once the library is created, if you click on it you will see one sample question. Below this sample you will see the “Add New Component” menu.

https://csc.learning-tribes.com/2021/09/22/lti-component/,LTI Component,"On Triboo, you can add an LTI component. On this post, you will learn how to add an LTI 1.1 component. 
� Note:  Triboo also support LTI 1.3 
Overview
When you add an LTI component to your course, Triboo is the LTI tool consumer, and the external tool or content is the LTI tool provider.
LTI is available by default in Studio, if not you can activate “lti” in the Advanced Settings>Advanced Module List page.
<img decoding=""async"" width=""810"" height=""461"" src=""https://i1.wp.com/csc.learning-tribes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image.png?resize=810%2C461&#038;ssl=1"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-4201"" srcset=""https://i1.wp.com/csc.learning-tribes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image.png?w=899&amp;ssl=1 899w, https://i1.wp.com/csc.learning-tribes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image.png?resize=300%2C171&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/csc.learning-tribes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image.png?resize=768%2C437&amp;ssl=1 768w"" sizes=""(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" data-pagespeed-url-hash=""2548306586""/>
Setup your LTI tool provider
This is the first step to implement LTI on your Triboo course. You must follow instructions given by your provider until you generate your Client Key and your Client Secret. You will need these 2 informations to create your LTI Passport.
Create your LTI Passport String
Go back to your Triboo course, then Advanced Settings from the Settings tab and scroll down to “LTI Passports”. 
Between the brackets you have to insert your LTI passport: (id:client_key:client_secret)
The id is is a value that you create to refer to the remote LTI tool provider. You should create an LTI ID that you can remember easily.The client key is a sequence of characters that you obtain from the LTI tool provider. The client key is used for authentication and can contain any number of characters. For example, your client key might be b289378-f88d-2929-ctools.school.edu.The client secret is a sequence of characters that you obtain from the LTI tool provider. The client secret is used for authentication and can contain any number of characters. For example, your client secret can be something as simple as secret, or it might be a string of numbers and letters such as 23746387264 or yt4984yr8.
To create an LTI passport, combine the LTI ID, client key, and client secret in the following format (be sure to include the colons).
{your_lti_id}:{client_key}:{client_secret}
It should look like that : 
[
    “H5P:tribooh5p-91ab9:RDdqUkq6s8cN7U0TD18HW4Tsd3gX3vAU”
]
You can also add multipe LTI Passports, separated by a comma :
[   
“test_lti_id:b289378-f88d-2929-ctools.umich.edu:secret”,   
“id_21441:b289378-f88d-2929-ctools.school.edu:23746387264”,   “book_lti_provider_from_new_york:b289378-f88d-2929-ctools.company.com:yt4984yr8”

LTI component settings
Accept grades past deadline   Specifies whether third party systems are allowed to post grades after the deadline. By   default, this value is set to True.   Button Text   Enter a custom label for the   button that opens the external LTI tool.   Custom Parameters   Sends additional parameters that are required by the remote LTI tool. The   parameters that you send depend on the specific LTI tool you are using.   Supply a key   and value for each custom parameter. The key is an identifier for the   parameter. Use the following format.   {key}={value}   For example, an LTI tool that displays an e-book might accept a page parameter to control which page the e-book opens to by default. The following example sends a page parameter to an LTI tool.   [“page=144“]       Display Name                  Specifies the name of the component. This name appears as a heading above the problem. Unique, descriptive display names help you identify problems quickly and accurately for analysis.   Hide External Tool   Controls whether the LTI component will display the remote LTI tool on the course page. Set the value to True to prevent the course page from displaying the remote LTI tool. Set the value to False to display the remote LTI tool and allow learners to interact with it.       LTI Application Information   The description of the remote LTI application. If the application requires a username or email address, use this field to inform learners that their information will be forwarded to the external application.   LTI ID (for   LTI 1.1 only)    Specifies the LTI ID for the remote LTI tool provider. This value must match the LTI ID that you entered as part of the LTI passport string for the LTI tool. LTI URL (for   LTI 1.3 only)   Specifies the URL of the remote LTI tool that this component launches.   Open in New Page   Select True if you want learners to click a link that opens the LTI tool in a new window. Select False if you want the LTI content to open in an IFrame in the current page. This setting is only used when Hide External Tool is set to False.           Request user’s email   Sends the learner’s email address to the remote LTI tool.   An LTI component will only send learners’ email addresses if the Open in New Page control is set to True. When the new window launches, the learners are warned that if they continue, their email address will be shared with the LTI provider.       Request user’s username   Sends the learner’s username to the remote LTI tool. This is the username that the learner used to register for the course. An LTI component will only send learners’ usernames if the Open in New Page  control is set to True. When the new window launches, the learners are warned that if they continue, their username will be shared with the LTI provider.       Scored   Indicates whether the LTI component receives a numerical score from the remote LTI tool provider. By default, this value is set to False.   Weight   Specifies the number of points possible for a problem. By default, if a remote LTI tool provider grades the problem, the problem is worth one point, and a learner’s score can be any value between zero and one. This setting is only applied if Scored is set to True."

� Note : take note that if the answer is changed after the polling starts, the learners who will have voted for that answer will have their votes automatically attributed to the new answer. Consequently, an answer such as « true » should not be replaced by an answer with the opposite meaning – such as « false ».

The certificate can be customized (color, logo, shapes…) and can display some static text on it. However, the certificate can only contains a limited choice of variables that are dynamically filled with information during the generation.
You must create your certificate template on a PowerPoint document (A4 format).
The variables are:

If your course is configured to issue certificates, you cannot start the course until the required certificates are activated.
Certificate Design
To add a certificate for your course, follow these steps.
1. Create your certificate template on a PowerPoint document (A4 format). Check the dedicated article.
Check with your Project Manager and Customer Success Manager to make sure the template is feasible
Validate the content and the layout
Send the final version to your Project Manager and Customer Success Manager 
2. When the certificate template has been integrated, You can preview the certificate to see how it will appear to a learner taking the course in the selected mode. Go under the Instructor Dashboard menu, select Certificates, you can now generate an example of the certificate.

Enable Certificates
Before  learners  can download certificates, you must enable certificates for your course.
1. From the Instructor Dashboard menu, select Certificates.
2. Click on “Generate Example Certificates” 
Certificates in an Instructor-Paced Course
In instructor-paced courses, two behaviors are possible.
By default, the instructor will decide when to generate the course certificates. Certificates need to be generated manually. To do so, from the Instructor Dashboard, select Certificates and use the Certificate Export section to generate the certificates.
You can configure your course to decide when learners will be informed that certificates are available. To do so, go to the Advanced Settings of your course and set the Certificates Display Behavior:
“End”: Learners will be informed when certificates are generated and the course ended.If the course hasn’t ended, then no message is displayed in Progress.If the course has ended, but the instructor hasn’t generated the certificates, then all learners see in Progress a message saying “The certificate is not yet available because it’s an instructor-paced course”.If the course has ended, and the instructor has generated the certificates, and the learner has a passing score, then the learner sees the button “Download Your Certificate” in Progress and a download link on the course card.If the course has ended, and the instructor has generated the certificates, but the learner has not a passing score, then the learner sees a message “You haven’t passed the course” in Progress.“Early no info” (option set by default): Learners with a passing score will be informed when certificates are generated.If the instructor has not generated the certificates, then no message is displayed in Progress.If the instructor has generated the certificates, and the learner has a passing score, then the learner sees the button “Download Your Certificate” in Progress and a download link on the course card.If the instructor has generated the certificates, but the learner has not a passing score, then no message is displayed in Progress.“Early with info”: All learners will be informed when certificates are generated.If the instructor has not generated the certificates, then a message “The certificate is not yet available because it’s an instructor-paced course” is displayed in Progress.If the instructor has generated the certificates, and the learner has a passing score, then the learner sees the button “Download Your Certificate” in Progress and a download link on the course card.If the instructor has generated the certificates, but the learner has not a passing score, then the learner sees in Progress a message saying “You haven’t passed the course”.
2. Alternatively, Instructor-paced courses can also be configured to enable Learner-Generated Certificates. In this scenario, learners will be able to request / generate their course certificate as soon as they pass the course, similarly to Self-paced courses. To do so:
From the Instructor Dashboard menu, select Certificates.In the Learner-Generated Certificates box, click on “Enable Learner-Generated Certificates” button to activated it.Confirm on the modal by clicking on “Ok“
�  Note: To switch back to the default behavior, you can click on “Disable Learning-Generated Certificates”.
Certificates in an Self-Paced Course
In self-paced courses, learners can request a course certificate as soon as they pass the course according to the Grading rules of the course. In their course Progress page, they should now see a message saying they qualified for a certificate and they can click on the button “Request Certificate” to generate one. Once the certificate is generated, learners see a message saying their certificate is available and they can download it by clicking on “Download Your Certificate”. A link “Download Certificate” should also appear on the course card.
If they haven’t requested their certificate yet, when they reach the end of the course and click the “Finish” button, we automatically request the generation of the certificate, so it’s ready to download from their course Progress page or from the course card.
Reminder: your course certificate is not available for issuing to learners until it is enable. Before enabling the certificate, check the following points:
The Course Completion rule and the Overall Grade Range criteria to get the certificate is in conformity with what you want.

https://csc.learning-tribes.com/2022/10/06/user-roles/,User Roles,"In Triboo, user roles can be granted at two general levels. First from the Platform Admin level, where general user permissions can be granted. Secondly, permissions can be granted at the Course level. Here we will summarize each permission and their respective effects.



Admin Panel Permissions



To access a particular user’s Platform Level permission, a platform administrator must go to the Admin Panel, which, for users with the appropriate access level, can be found at the Top Menu Bar from the Dashboard. The following is the list of available permissions that can be edited for each user:



Active – This option can be toggled to set the user’s account as Active or Inactive.Platform Access – This designates what level of general platform access each user is granted. It is divided into four categories:Learner – This role designated a standard learner. These users are able to access the platform, but are restricted to only taking courses made available to them, either by direct enrollment, or those courses available of the Explore page, that permit the Learner to self-enroll. This role is restricted from accessing Analytics, Studio, or the Admin Panel. When entering courses, they are only permitted to view the course content, but have no rights to administrate or edit any course.Studio Admin – This role allows the user to access Studio, in order to (A) Create a new course, of which the user will be the default Course Administrator, and (B) Access any other courses in which they have been made Administrators or Staff members by the Course Administrator of that course.Super Studio Admin – This role allows the user to access Studio, in order to (A) Create a new course and learning path, of which the user will be the default Course/Learning Path Administrator, and (B) Access any other courses and learning path in which they have been made Administrators or Staff members by the Course/Learning Path Administrator of that course.Platform Admin – These users can access all courses in Studio, and are able to edit any course the chose, in addition to creating new courses.Analytics – Access to the Triboo Analytics suite can also be divided into two levels:Restricted – These users can only see the course reports in Analytics of the courses that they have been added specifically to the Course Team.Full Access – These users can see all courses in Analytics, even if they are not part of the a particular course’s Courses Team. Internal Catalog Access – This option can be toggled to allow or restrict a user’s access to the Explore Page.External Catalogs – All other integrated external catalogs to your platform can be granted, or restricted, by using this toggle. Each Triboo platform can have many, or none of these, depending on how many external catalogs have been integrated.



Instructor Dashboard Permissions



Each course on your Triboo platform is equipped with its own Instructor Dashboard. From here Instructors can manage many facets of their courses. You can access a course’s Instructor Dashboard from the course’s dashboard, by clicking the gear icon (to the top right).

Once inside, in order to add Course Level permissions, the administrator must choose the Membership tab. Scroll down to the section titled Course Team Management.

 *This feature is a paid-option and can be included if you are an Edflex client. 
When the Edflex catalog is updated on Triboo?
The Edflex catalog is updated on Triboo twice a day at 3AM and 3PM UTC Time.  So any changes on Edflex side will be then reflected on the Edflex catalog on Triboo.
How the translations are managed?
On Triboo, we display the categories:
In the language selected by the user for the platform, if we have a translation from Edflex API.If we don’t have a translation for the selected language, in the first language for which we have a translation. Languages are evaluated in the same order they are configured in Edflex API settings (can be configure during the setting phase with your project manager). 
For example, if the user displays the platform in Italian, we’ll try to find the Italian name of the category. As we don’t have one, we’ll evaluate the languages set in order: if we have a name in English, we display the English name, otherwise we try to find a Spanish name, then a French name (all this is subordinate to the translations handled by our partner, Edflex)."

To manage the course visibility in the catalog, go to Schedule and Details in the course of your choice.
By default, the course visibility is set to “Full public”. If you do not wish to show that specific course in the catalog, change to “Accessible by URL” or “Private”.
Accessible by URL: The course is not visible on the catalog but the course about page can be accessible when a user is logged in and then he/she can enroll into the course.Private: The course is not visible on the catalog and the course about page is not accessible.

On Triboo, progress (or completion) is different than grade. 
Progress – This takes the total amount of sub-sections in the course and divides it evenly.Grade – Is weighted distributed differently. The Administrator of the course decides where how the “Grade Weight” should be distributed. Check our CSC article on Grade Setup and Application.
 To hit 100% progress, the learner must: 
see more than 50% of the video,complete the SCORM module (depening on the SCORM configuration, the platform can expect a score or a completion rate),try quizzes,and stay at least 1 second on the page.
Note: Survey, poll and word cloud component are not mandatory to get the page completion.

https://csc.learning-tribes.com/2019/05/15/delete-a-learners-state-for-a-problem/,Delete a Learner’s State for a Problem,"You can completely delete a learner’s database history, or “state”, for a problem. You can only delete learner state for one learner at a time.
For example, you realize that a problem needs to be rewritten after only a few of your learners have answered it. To resolve this situation, you rewrite the problem and then delete learner state only for the affected learners so that they can try again.
To delete a learner’s entire history for a problem from the database, you need that learner’s username
 or email address.
Note: Learner state is deleted permanently by this process. This action cannot be undone.
When you delete a learner’s state for an open response assessment (ORA) problem, the learner will have to start the assignment from the beginning, including submitting responses and going through the required assessment steps.
You can use either the Staff Debug Info option or the instructor dashboard to delete learner state.
Option 1: Staff Debug Info
View the live version of your course.Select Course and navigate to the component that contains the problem.Display the problem, and then select Staff Debug Info. The Staff Debug viewer opens.In the Username field, enter the learner’s email address or username, and then select Delete Student State. A message indicates a successful adjustment.
To close the Staff Debug viewer, click on the browser page outside of the viewer.
Option 2: Instructor Dashboard
You must first obtain the unique identifier of the problem.To do so, go in Course, and navigate to the component that contains the problem you want to reset for all learners.Select Staff Debug Info. Information about the problem appears, including its location. To copy the location of the problem, select the entire value after location =, right click, and then select Copy. To close the Staff Debug viewer, click on the browser page outside of the viewerSelect Instructor, and then select Student Admin.In the Student-specific grade adjustment section of the page, enter both the learner’s email address or username and the unique problem identifier, and then select Delete Student State for Problem."

Depending on the specification of your platform. Triboo offers both a email/password and SSO login options.



Email/Password Logins



1- The most common error received is the “Email or password is incorrect.” This occurs when either the user has entered one, or both of the credentials incorrectly. 



<img decoding=""async"" src=""https://i0.wp.com/csc.learning-tribes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/platform-email-password-login-issue_2.png?resize=341%2C436&#038;ssl=1"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-3394"" width=""341"" height=""436"" srcset=""https://i0.wp.com/csc.learning-tribes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/platform-email-password-login-issue_2.png?w=530&amp;ssl=1 530w, https://i0.wp.com/csc.learning-tribes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/platform-email-password-login-issue_2.png?resize=235%2C300&amp;ssl=1 235w"" sizes=""(max-width: 341px) 100vw, 341px"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" data-pagespeed-url-hash=""85432982""/>



Solution: Use the “Forgot password?” link below the password field. Once clicked, enter your email into the Password Assistance form.

 Ask the user if they are able to directly access other pages of the platform (ex. https://TRIBOO-URL/my_courses/all-courses). If so, move to step 2. If not, please escalate to your Global Triboo Lead Support representative.If the user is able to navigate to other pages within the platform, but not the Dashboard, then it is likely that a course on the user’s Dashboard is exhibiting an error that is locking the user’s dashboard.To identify the course causing the error, log-in as the user and manually navigate in the URL to the My Courses page (…/my_courses/all-courses). Right-click and open each course in a new tab, until you have identified the course exhibiting the error. The course will display the error “There has been an error on the TRIBOOPLATFORMNAME servers” Once the course has been identified, find the course in Studio, enter the first Section>Subsection>Unit of the course and View Live. Pass through each page on the course until you arrive at the page with the error. [Note: You may have to scroll down to the bottom of each page to locate the error.] Contact the ticket requester and explain the error found and its location. Ask from the requestor if the Content Block causing the error can be Modified or Deleted immediately. Fixing the code or deleting the block completely should normally resolve the issue for all users enrolled in the affected course.

�Note: Platform Admins are exclude from the ranking. Leaners are ordered by score, then user_id (in case they have same score). 



�Note: Learner’s point are updated in live, except for one mission “Logging into Triboo everyday, for at least 30 minutes“, which is updated daily after Triboo Analytics run.



How the month ranking is working?



The filter “ranking by month” allows you to see the ranking of users over the last 30 days. Every day users earn new points with their activity on the platform. These points are added to their total score. 



On May 1st, the platform saves your total score. For example you have 1,500 points, this is your total score at the end of the previous month (30th of April). On May 22nd you get a total score of 1,800 points. If we want to know how many points you got in May, just make the difference between your current total score and your total score at the beginning of the month (1800 – 1500 = 300 points). 



So each user has a number of points earned for the current month (May) and a ranking is made. ​If a user logs in in January 2021 for the last time, his/her total points will not have changed since January, so it is the same on the 1st and 22nd of May. So his score number for the month is 0."

A facebook feed embedded feature integrated in a course
Before being
able to add a facebook embedded feature, go to the unit you want to add the
feature.
Create a new raw HTML component and copy and paste the following code:
<div id=""fb-root""></div>
<script>(function(d, s, id) {
  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];
  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;
  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;
  js.src = 'https://connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&version=v2.11&appId=281170645314039';
  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);
}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));</script>
In order to integrate a Facebook feed into your course you must first go to facebook to get the URL link of the page you want to be inserted into your course.

When your course reaches the end date set-up, then the course card display will be different and a note will be added to the learner, to let them know that the course is archived. 
Learners can still have access to the course if they are already enrolled. However the course is not visible in the catalog anymore and new learners cannot self-enrolled to this archived course.
The courses data are avaiable on Triboo Analytics and on the learner transcript.

Note: Do not import an image which has a name containing special characters (é, è…). If you upload an image in the objective of it being the badge illustration, do not put spaces either.
In the window which opens, select the image you want to upload and click on Open.
Note: You can import several files at the same time by pressing the SHIFT OR CTRL keys (SHIFT and Command on Mac) to select several files, then click on Open.
When the upload is completed. The imported file appears on the Files & Uploads page. You will find the file URL, the type of file and the date it was added.
Note: The URL in the static code format is used as an identification for all image and file you upload. Everytime you upload a file or an image, it is to use in the studio. To do so, you will always need the static code of the image/file.
To add more files, click on Browse your computer again.
If you have multiple pages of images and files, it may not appear at the top of the page. To see images according to an upload date, double click on Date Added.
Note: When you wish to replace an image/file, you have to delete the previous one so that you can import a new image/file with the same name as the one to be replaced. If you don’t delete the previous one, the risk is that it isn’t uploaded because of the identical name code.
To delete a file, click on the trash icon on the right of the file URL.
Unlock a file
By default, the file uploaded is locked that means that the web URL only allows learners who are enrolled in your course and signed in to access the file.
To unlock a file, desable the switch icon in the row for the file.

Sections
The Sections represent the highest category in the course heirarchy. They can, for example, correspond to the weeks of the course or the sequences:  Section 1 will be named Week 1, Section 2 will be named Week 2, etc. The name of the sections appears in the menu to the left of the platform.
Section MinimumRecommended1Between 4 and 8
SubSections
A Subsection represents one sub-category of a section. That corresponds to one lesson, which is made up of different typs of units such as videos, texts, images, discussions, exercises and homework. It is an interactive representation of material you would cover during one part of a classic course. The name of the subsections also appears in the menu to the left of the platform.
�Note:   A subsection should contain at least one unit. 
Subsection MinimumRecommended1Between 5 and 10
Units
One Unit constitutes a supplementary category for organizing your course content. Unlike the sections and subsection, the units do not appear at the left of the platform. 
�Note:   A subsection should contain at least one component.
Unit MinimumRecommended1Between 1 and 4
Avoid to do more than that or else navigating will be difficult for the learner as he cannot go back to the previous page from the course outline. The learner can only navigate between the units with the navigation icons at the bottom of the page. 
Components
Components make up a unit and contain the course content. There are 4 types of components: Resources, Learner Activities, Quiz and Blended Learning. One unit can contain as many different types of components as desired, but we recommand not to add more than 2 to 3 components.
Resources
Add content to your course, such as text, vide, SCORM module, PDF…
Learner Activities
Train your learners with collaborative activities and/or add discussion forum.
Quiz
Use the exercise problems to add quizzes and automatic corrections. There are several types of quizz that you can add, and many ways of including it in your course.

Certificate Design
To add a certificate for your course, follow these steps.
1. Create your certificate template on a PowerPoint document (A4 format). Check the dedicated article.
Check with your Project Manager and Customer Success Manager to make sure the template is feasible
Validate the content and the layout
Send the final version to your Project Manager and Customer Success Manager 
2. When the certificate template has been integrated, You can preview the certificate to see how it will appear to a learner taking the course in the selected mode. Go under the Instructor Dashboard menu, select Certificates, you can now generate an example of the certificate.

Enable Certificates
Before  learners  can download certificates, you must enable certificates for your course.
1. From the Instructor Dashboard menu, select Certificates.
2. Click on “Generate Example Certificates” 
Certificates in an Instructor-Paced Course
In instructor-paced courses, two behaviors are possible.
By default, the instructor will decide when to generate the course certificates. Certificates need to be generated manually. To do so, from the Instructor Dashboard, select Certificates and use the Certificate Export section to generate the certificates.
You can configure your course to decide when learners will be informed that certificates are available. To do so, go to the Advanced Settings of your course and set the Certificates Display Behavior:
“End”: Learners will be informed when certificates are generated and the course ended.If the course hasn’t ended, then no message is displayed in Progress.If the course has ended, but the instructor hasn’t generated the certificates, then all learners see in Progress a message saying “The certificate is not yet available because it’s an instructor-paced course”.If the course has ended, and the instructor has generated the certificates, and the learner has a passing score, then the learner sees the button “Download Your Certificate” in Progress and a download link on the course card.If the course has ended, and the instructor has generated the certificates, but the learner has not a passing score, then the learner sees a message “You haven’t passed the course” in Progress.“Early no info” (option set by default): Learners with a passing score will be informed when certificates are generated.If the instructor has not generated the certificates, then no message is displayed in Progress.If the instructor has generated the certificates, and the learner has a passing score, then the learner sees the button “Download Your Certificate” in Progress and a download link on the course card.If the instructor has generated the certificates, but the learner has not a passing score, then no message is displayed in Progress.“Early with info”: All learners will be informed when certificates are generated.If the instructor has not generated the certificates, then a message “The certificate is not yet available because it’s an instructor-paced course” is displayed in Progress.If the instructor has generated the certificates, and the learner has a passing score, then the learner sees the button “Download Your Certificate” in Progress and a download link on the course card.If the instructor has generated the certificates, but the learner has not a passing score, then the learner sees in Progress a message saying “You haven’t passed the course”.
2. Alternatively, Instructor-paced courses can also be configured to enable Learner-Generated Certificates. In this scenario, learners will be able to request / generate their course certificate as soon as they pass the course, similarly to Self-paced courses. To do so:
From the Instructor Dashboard menu, select Certificates.In the Learner-Generated Certificates box, click on “Enable Learner-Generated Certificates” button to activated it.Confirm on the modal by clicking on “Ok“
�  Note: To switch back to the default behavior, you can click on “Disable Learning-Generated Certificates”.
Certificates in an Self-Paced Course
In self-paced courses, learners can request a course certificate as soon as they pass the course according to the Grading rules of the course. In their course Progress page, they should now see a message saying they qualified for a certificate and they can click on the button “Request Certificate” to generate one. Once the certificate is generated, learners see a message saying their certificate is available and they can download it by clicking on “Download Your Certificate”. A link “Download Certificate” should also appear on the course card.
If they haven’t requested their certificate yet, when they reach the end of the course and click the “Finish” button, we automatically request the generation of the certificate, so it’s ready to download from their course Progress page or from the course card.

height and width of the image in pixels.Coordinate
pairs that define the region or regions where you want learners to click.
To collect the information, you need about your image, use an image editing tool such as Microsoft Paint. To specify a rectangular region, you need two coordinate pairs: the upper-left corner and the lower-right corner.
� Note: The coordinate pairs for all images start with (0,0) in the upper-left corner of the image and increase in value toward the lower-right corner, similar to the progression of reading English.

https://csc.learning-tribes.com/2019/02/21/adding-videos/,Working with Video Component,"Working with Video Component
When adding a video to a course, first post the video on video hosting platform or directly on Triboo, then create a link to the video within the course. The video is therefore played through the video player. The video player supports video formats .mp4, .webm, .ogg, and .mpeg. 
Note: To be sure that all the browsers will be able to play the video, we highly recommend using mp4 format.
Note: Do not add special character to your name file.
The Edx player can access YouTube videos. However, since YouTube is not accessible everywhere, we recommend to upload your videos directly into Triboo. When a learner consults a video from the course, if YouTube is not accessible to the learner, the video from the third party site will start up automatically. The learner can also click on the link to download the video from the third party site.
You can use any third party site to post your videos. Remember that this site will undoubtedly need to be able to manage high user traffic.
Note: We also recommend optimizing the size of your videos. It must be less than 80Mb."
https://csc.learning-tribes.com/2019/02/21/drag-and-drop/,Drag and Drop,"Drag and Drop
The drag and drop is a problem allowing the learner to move elements from a point A to a point B. 
In this example, we are going to move text or image elements onto a background image. It is possible to define as many draggable elements, and as many target zones as you wish. The learner completes this problem once all the draggable elements  have found their correct target zone. 
Here is a quick guide to understanding the elements of the Drag and Drop problem type:
<img decoding=""async"" src=""https://i0.wp.com/csc.learning-tribes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Drag-and-drop_hint.png?resize=350%2C317&#038;ssl=1"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-1788"" width=""350"" height=""317"" srcset=""https://i0.wp.com/csc.learning-tribes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Drag-and-drop_hint.png?w=884&amp;ssl=1 884w, https://i0.wp.com/csc.learning-tribes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Drag-and-drop_hint.png?resize=300%2C272&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/csc.learning-tribes.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Drag-and-drop_hint.png?resize=768%2C697&amp;ssl=1 768w"" sizes=""(max-width: 350px) 100vw, 350px"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" data-pagespeed-url-hash=""1230540578""/>

4. Complete the
following fields: 
Display name: corresponding to the title of the poll.Feedback: give the learners a feedback after their answers are submitted.Private Results: allow or block the results from showing after polling.Maximum Submissions: determine the maximum number of times the learner can submit an answer to the poll. 
� Note : Putting a value other than 1 in this field
implies that the Private Results field should have True as an answer. Putting 0
as the value in this field allows the learners to submit an answer any number
of times they wish.
Answer: write asuggested
answer to the poll question.
� Note : take note that if the answer is changed after the polling starts, the learners who will have voted for that answer will have their votes automatically attributed to the new answer. Consequently, an answer such as « true » should not be replaced by an answer with the opposite meaning – such as « false ». 
If a suggested answer is deleted, the learner votes in favor of that
answer will also be deleted automatically. The learners can therefore vote
again and they won’t be penalized as far as their progress in the MOOC. 
Question: write the question.Image URL: add an image to the question, putting either the URL link or, if the image was already uploaded to the Files & Uploads part of the course, retrieve the studio link (link format : </static/nom_image>).
� Note : it is possible to put a written
answer only (Answer) OR an image (URL Image) OR a written answer with an image.

https://csc.learning-tribes.com/2019/02/21/numerical-input/,Numerical Input,"Numerical Input
A numerical input problem accepts text input by the learner and evaluates it based on its numeric value. The answer is correct if it is within a specified numerical tolerance of the expected answer.
Put the question first and then the answer after the = sign. Add, if necessary, after the +- sign, the margin or percentage of
 error.
 Example:
What is the value of Pi :
     = 3.14159 +- .02
Enter the approximate value of 502×9 :
     = 4518 +- 15%

For example, let’s say you have a bank of 100 questions, but you want to just show 25 random questions from this bank to each learner so that that each will receive a unique assessment. Below we will delve into creating the question bank.
When you enter Studio, from the home page you will see, to the top-right, a green button that says “+ New Library”. Click this button.
A “Create New Library” form will appear at the top of the page. Fill out the following information:
Library Name – For general identification Organization – This is where you would specify the platform you desire the Library to appear in.Library Code – Unique code that identifies the library
After the form is completely filled, click the “Create” button below. 
Once the library is created, if you click on it you will see one sample question. Below this sample you will see the “Add New Component” menu. 
For a Question bank, you will have the following options:

https://csc.learning-tribes.com/2021/09/22/lti-component/,LTI Component,"On Triboo, you can add an LTI component. On this post, you will learn how to add an LTI 1.1 component. 
� Note:  Triboo also support LTI 1.3 
Overview
When you add an LTI component to your course, Triboo is the LTI tool consumer, and the external tool or content is the LTI tool provider.
LTI is available by default in Studio, if not you can activate “lti” in the Advanced Settings>Advanced Module List page.
<img decoding=""async"" width=""810"" height=""461"" src=""https://i1.wp.com/csc.learning-tribes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image.png?resize=810%2C461&#038;ssl=1"" alt="""" class=""wp-image-4201"" srcset=""https://i1.wp.com/csc.learning-tribes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image.png?w=899&amp;ssl=1 899w, https://i1.wp.com/csc.learning-tribes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image.png?resize=300%2C171&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i1.wp.com/csc.learning-tribes.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/image.png?resize=768%2C437&amp;ssl=1 768w"" sizes=""(max-width: 810px) 100vw, 810px"" data-recalc-dims=""1"" data-pagespeed-url-hash=""2548306586""/>
Setup your LTI tool provider
This is the first step to implement LTI on your Triboo course. You must follow instructions given by your provider until you generate your Client Key and your Client Secret. You will need these 2 informations to create your LTI Passport.
Create your LTI Passport String
Go back to your Triboo course, then Advanced Settings from the Settings tab and scroll down to “LTI Passports”. 
Between the brackets you have to insert your LTI passport: (id:client_key:client_secret)
The id is is a value that you create to refer to the remote LTI tool provider. You should create an LTI ID that you can remember easily.The client key is a sequence of characters that you obtain from the LTI tool provider. The client key is used for authentication and can contain any number of characters. For example, your client key might be b289378-f88d-2929-ctools.school.edu.The client secret is a sequence of characters that you obtain from the LTI tool provider. The client secret is used for authentication and can contain any number of characters. For example, your client secret can be something as simple as secret, or it might be a string of numbers and letters such as 23746387264 or yt4984yr8.
To create an LTI passport, combine the LTI ID, client key, and client secret in the following format (be sure to include the colons).
{your_lti_id}:{client_key}:{client_secret}
It should look like that : 
[
    “H5P:tribooh5p-91ab9:RDdqUkq6s8cN7U0TD18HW4Tsd3gX3vAU”
]
You can also add multipe LTI Passports, separated by a comma :
[   
“test_lti_id:b289378-f88d-2929-ctools.umich.edu:secret”,   
“id_21441:b289378-f88d-2929-ctools.school.edu:23746387264”,   “book_lti_provider_from_new_york:b289378-f88d-2929-ctools.company.com:yt4984yr8”

LTI component settings
Accept grades past deadline   Specifies whether third party systems are allowed to post grades after the deadline. By   default, this value is set to True.   Button Text   Enter a custom label for the   button that opens the external LTI tool.   Custom Parameters   Sends additional parameters that are required by the remote LTI tool. The   parameters that you send depend on the specific LTI tool you are using.   Supply a key   and value for each custom parameter. The key is an identifier for the   parameter. Use the following format.   {key}={value}   For example, an LTI tool that displays an e-book might accept a page parameter to control which page the e-book opens to by default. The following example sends a page parameter to an LTI tool.   [“page=144“]       Display Name                  Specifies the name of the component. This name appears as a heading above the problem. Unique, descriptive display names help you identify problems quickly and accurately for analysis.   Hide External Tool   Controls whether the LTI component will display the remote LTI tool on the course page. Set the value to True to prevent the course page from displaying the remote LTI tool. Set the value to False to display the remote LTI tool and allow learners to interact with it.       LTI Application Information   The description of the remote LTI application. If the application requires a username or email address, use this field to inform learners that their information will be forwarded to the external application.   LTI ID (for   LTI 1.1 only)    Specifies the LTI ID for the remote LTI tool provider. This value must match the LTI ID that you entered as part of the LTI passport string for the LTI tool. LTI URL (for   LTI 1.3 only)   Specifies the URL of the remote LTI tool that this component launches.   Open in New Page   Select True if you want learners to click a link that opens the LTI tool in a new window. Select False if you want the LTI content to open in an IFrame in the current page. This setting is only used when Hide External Tool is set to False.           Request user’s email   Sends the learner’s email address to the remote LTI tool.   An LTI component will only send learners’ email addresses if the Open in New Page control is set to True. When the new window launches, the learners are warned that if they continue, their email address will be shared with the LTI provider.       Request user’s username   Sends the learner’s username to the remote LTI tool. This is the username that the learner used to register for the course. An LTI component will only send learners’ usernames if the Open in New Page  control is set to True. When the new window launches, the learners are warned that if they continue, their username will be shared with the LTI provider.       Scored   Indicates whether the LTI component receives a numerical score from the remote LTI tool provider. By default, this value is set to False.   Weight   Specifies the number of points possible for a problem. By default, if a remote LTI tool provider grades the problem, the problem is worth one point, and a learner’s score can be any value between zero and one. This setting is only applied if Scored is set to True."

� Note : take note that if the answer is changed after the polling starts, the learners who will have voted for that answer will have their votes automatically attributed to the new answer. Consequently, an answer such as « true » should not be replaced by an answer with the opposite meaning – such as « false ». If a suggested answer is deleted, the learner’s votes in favor of that answer will also be deleted automatically.
